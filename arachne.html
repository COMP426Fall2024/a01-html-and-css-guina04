        <p>
            Arachne was an arrogant, but expert spinstress in Ancient Greece who boasted that she was better weaver than the Goddess Athena.
            This confidence resulted in a tapestry challenge between the 2 women.  Athena's piece depicted the Gods in a gloriful manner while Arachne's showed their romantic pursuits.
            Athena was furious at Arachne's tapestry and tore it to pieces, resulting in Arachne hanging herself.  Athena would not let Arachne die however, and turned the rope into a 
            cobweb and Arahcne into a spider, which is how she would remain for the rest of her life.

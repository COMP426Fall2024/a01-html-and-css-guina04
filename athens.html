            The founder of the city we now know as Athens was a half man half snake names Cereceops, who initially attempted to name the city after himself.  
            However, the Gods of Olympus saw the land and wanted to name it after themselves.  The 2 Gods who most desired the name of the city were Athena and Poseidon.  
            A feud erupted, and in order to settle it, Zeus decided that each God would present a gift to Cerecrops and he would pick the better of the 2 and name the city accordingly.

            Poseidon was the first to present his gift, a spring of water that lept from the ground when he struck his Trident on the rock.  The idea was that the city would never face drought, 
            but the water was salty like the oceans Poseidon ruled over.  Athena's gift was received much better by the people, as she planted a seed that grew into a large olive tree which would give the people food, oil, and firewood.  
            The people proclaimed Athena to be the patroness of the city, and that is how the capitol of Greece got its name.
